Many ways to do it but no easy ways. After multiple attempts, I figured out these steps working for my purpose:\r\nCreate a new repo on GitHub, don’t initiate anything, an empty repo will do (remember to copy the URL)\r\nIn RStudio IDE, create a new project, select distill blog/website (remember to check the configuration with github page), distill will create basic things you need for the web\r\nHow to push your local project to the existing repo? Well, use your terminal.\r\ngit init\r\ngit add .\r\ngit commit -m ‘First commit’\r\ngit remote add origin PUT THE URL HERE\r\ngit remote -v\r\ngit push origin master\r\nGo to your GitHub repo to confirm whether the files are there.\r\nGo back to your RStudio IDE, under the tools-version control-set up while noticing the URL is automatically copied there. Click Ok. Restart your RStudio IDE. Git is available now.\r\nYou think the Git function is working and you’re all good. No you are not. The pull and push buttons do not work.\r\ngit push -u origin master\r\nYOU ARE NOW ALL SET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
